# Simply Wikipedia

Simply Wikipedia is a minimalist, redesigned skin for Wikipedia focused on enhancing readability and accessibility. By reducing clutter and improving navigation, Simply Wikipedia aims to provide a cleaner, more user-friendly interface for Wikipedia, making it easier to consume and engage with information.

## Project Goals

Simply Wikipedia is designed with inclusivity and accessibility in mind, aiming to create a smoother reading experience for all. Our future plans include:

Dyslexia-Friendly Fonts to support users with dyslexia
AI-Powered Language Translations for multilingual accessibility
Customizable Themes (e.g., dark mode) to suit various reading environments
Optimized Navigation for faster, easier access to information
Current Release: 0.1.0

The first release, version 0.1.0, provides a basic template of the redesigned skin, establishing a foundation for future development. This initial version focuses on core functionality without advanced styling, allowing us to build on a solid base as we implement accessibility features and visual improvements.
